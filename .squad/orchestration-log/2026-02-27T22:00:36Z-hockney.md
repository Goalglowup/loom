# Orchestration Log: Hockney (Tester)

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-27T22:00:36Z  
**Agent:** Hockney (Tester)  
**Mode:** Background  
**Status:** Completed

## Summary

Completed migration of all 6 Selenium smoke test files and helpers.ts to Playwright with Chromium. Implemented automated UI documentation generation pipeline with new npm scripts and generator script.

## Work Completed

- Migrated all 6 smoke test files from Selenium WebDriver to Playwright API
- Rewrote `tests/smoke/helpers.ts` with Playwright-native utilities
- Added `screenshotIfDocsMode` helper for conditional screenshot capture in docs mode
- Created `scripts/generate-ui-docs.ts` for automated UI documentation generation
- Added npm scripts: `docs:screenshots`, `docs:generate`, `docs:build`
- Created `docs/` directory structure
- Updated `devDependencies`: removed `selenium-webdriver` and `chromedriver`, added `playwright`
- Build validation passed; all test scenarios and assertions preserved

## Artifacts

- `tests/smoke/` — all 6 test files + helpers.ts
- `scripts/generate-ui-docs.ts` — new documentation generator
- `package.json` — updated dependencies and scripts
- `package-lock.json` — synchronized
- `docs/` — new directory for generated UI documentation

## Key Decisions

- Playwright with Chromium (no version pinning on browser binary needed)
- Vitest remains sole test runner; serial execution preserved
- `playwright` in `devDependencies` only
- Text-based selectors preferred: `page.locator(':text("Label")')`
- `screenshotIfDocsMode` is async and must be awaited

## Next Steps

- Team review of Playwright API patterns for future test authorship
- Integration with documentation build pipeline
