# Team Decisions
## 2026-02-27: Subtenant Hierarchy with Self-Foreign Key

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**What:** Added `parent_id` column to `tenants` table (nullable self-FK) with ON DELETE CASCADE  
**Why:** Product requires subtenant hierarchy; single-parent tree avoids complexity of multi-parent graphs  
**Impact:** Tenants can form a parent-child hierarchy; deleting a parent cascades to all subtenants; portal operators manage parent tenant + all descendants  
**Alternatives Considered:** Separate join table (rejected: overkill for linear hierarchy)  

## 2026-02-27: Agent System Architecture

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**What:** Implemented agents table with per-agent `provider_config`, `system_prompt`, `skills`, `mcp_endpoints`, and `merge_policies` (JSONB). Every API key bound to exactly one agent (NOT NULL FK). Every trace records which agent processed it (nullable for historical rows).  
**Why:** Product requires configurable agents with isolated provider configs; API keys must be agent-scoped; audit requires recording which agent handled each request  
**Impact:** Agents enable multi-agent workflows; per-agent provider configs; API key access control scoped to agents, not just tenants; traces linked to agents for analytics  
**Decisions:**
- `agents.merge_policies` is NOT NULL with application-level default (avoids null-checks in gateway)
- Seeded "Default" agent for every existing tenant before enforcing `api_keys.agent_id NOT NULL`
- `traces.agent_id` is nullable (preserves historical data integrity)
- Down migration reverses in strict FK dependency order

## 2026-02-27: Agent Provider Config Encryption

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**What:** Agent `provider_config` JSONB field encrypted on write (AES-256-GCM) and sanitized on read (returns `hasApiKey: boolean` instead of raw key)  
**Why:** API keys inside agent config must be protected; consistency with existing tenant settings pattern  
**Impact:** Zero new encryption logic; same encrypt-on-write / sanitize-on-read as tenant settings; sensitive data never exposed in API responses  

## 2026-02-27: Portal Agent Routes — Membership-Based Access Control

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**What:** Agent GET/PUT/DELETE endpoints verify access via `JOIN tenant_memberships` on agent's tenant, not tenantId equality  
**Why:** Users can be members of multiple tenants; should access agents from any tenant they're a member of  
**Impact:** More permissive and flexible for multi-tenant users; agent access tied to tenant membership, not JWT tenant context  

## 2026-02-27: Portal Agent Routes — Dynamic SET Builder for Partial Updates

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**What:** PUT /v1/portal/agents/:id uses dynamic SET clause builder; only supplied fields updated (plus always-updated `updated_at`)  
**Why:** Support partial updates without coalescing (which would silently drop null inputs); avoids read-then-write  
**Impact:** Clean parameterized SQL, no injection risk, explicit control over which fields are updated  

## 2026-02-27: Agent Config Inheritance — JavaScript Layer

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**What:** Resolved agent config computed in TypeScript (not SQL). Build ordered array [agent, immediate_tenant, parent_chain...]. Use `.find(non-null)` for providerConfig/systemPrompt, union+dedup for skills/mcpEndpoints, agent-only for mergePolicies.  
**Why:** Mixed inheritance semantics (first-non-null vs. union) cleaner in application code than monolithic SQL; tenant chain typically shallow (depth 1-5); keeps queries simple and testable  
**Impact:** Readable inheritance logic; easy to test and debug; no complex CASE/COALESCE chains  

## 2026-02-27: Subtenant Creation with Transaction

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**What:** POST /v1/portal/subtenants wraps tenant INSERT + membership INSERT in explicit BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK transaction  
**Why:** Prevent orphaned tenant if membership insert fails  
**Impact:** Atomic subtenant creation; consistent with existing signup transaction pattern  

## 2026-02-27: Analytics Rollup with Recursive CTE

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**What:** Added optional `rollup?: boolean` parameter to three analytics functions (`getAnalyticsSummary`, `getTimeseriesMetrics`, `getModelBreakdown`). When true, prepend `WITH RECURSIVE subtenant_tree` CTE to walk `tenants.parent_id` and aggregate traces across all descendants.  
**Why:** Portal operators managing a parent tenant need aggregate analytics across all subtenants; backward compatible (rollup defaults to false)  
**Impact:** Parent tenant dashboard shows rolled-up metrics; partition pruning preserved (CTE restricted to tenants table); no impact on existing callers  
**Alternatives Considered:** Materialised view of tenant trees (rejected: overkill, stale-data issues); JOIN on tenants at query time (rejected: complex, potential index miss)  

## 2026-02-27: Gateway Agent-Aware Lookup — Two-Query Pattern

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**What:** Split agent config resolution into two queries: (1) api_keys → agents → immediate tenant (one JOIN), (2) separate recursive CTE for parent chain if parent_id non-null  
**Why:** Simpler than monolithic CTE; parent chain query skipped entirely for common case (no parent); keeps each query readable and independently testable  
**Impact:** Clean separation of concerns; better performance on non-parent tenants  

## 2026-02-27: Provider Cache Keyed by Agent ID

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**What:** `providerCache` keyed by `agentId` (fallback to `tenantId`). Added `tenantIndex: Map<tenantId, Set<cacheKey>>` to allow `evictProvider(tenantId)` to clear all agent-level providers for a tenant without changing the public API.  
**Why:** Agents can have their own provider configs; need per-agent caching. Reverse index allows admin routes to continue using existing `evictProvider(tenantId)` signature.  
**Impact:** Correct per-agent provider instances; existing admin callers unaffected; zero API changes  

## 2026-02-27: MCP Tool Routing on Non-Streaming Only

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**What:** `handleMcpRoundTrip()` called only on non-streaming (JSON) responses. Streaming responses not eligible for MCP routing in Phase 1.  
**Why:** Streaming + tool_calls requires buffering full SSE stream before routing to MCP and re-streaming follow-up. Significant complexity and latency. Common agentic pattern (tool use) typically non-streaming.  
**Impact:** Tool calling works on JSON responses; streaming MCP support deferred to Phase 2  

## 2026-02-27: Agent Merge Policies Applied at Request-Time

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**What:** `applyAgentToRequest()` in `src/agent.ts` applies merge policies to outbound request body before provider. Original `request.body` not mutated.  
**Why:** Keeps providers clean (see plain OpenAI-format requests); immutability avoids side effects  
**Impact:** Providers receive consistent OpenAI format; no surprises for middleware or test code reading request.body  

## 2026-02-27: SubtenantsPage Navigation Gated by Owner Role

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**What:** Subtenants nav link only visible to `currentRole === 'owner'`. Agents nav visible to all authenticated users.  
**Why:** Creating subtenants is administrative; agents are tenant-scoped configs that all members may need. Mirrors API Keys visibility (all roles).  
**Impact:** Role-based nav structure; members see Agents but not Subtenants; owners see both  

## 2026-02-27: AgentEditor as Inline Panel (Not Modal)

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**What:** AgentEditor renders as inline panel on AgentsPage (above table) with discriminated union state: `{ mode: 'closed' } | { mode: 'create' } | { mode: 'edit'; agent: Agent }`  
**Why:** Simpler state management; keeps agents list visible for context; matches existing MembersPage pattern; no animation primitives needed  
**Impact:** Cleaner UX; full agents list visible while editing; type-safe editor state  

## 2026-02-27: Agent Resolved Config Lazy-Loaded

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**What:** `getResolvedAgentConfig` API call only made when user expands "View inherited config"; cached in component state for session  
**Why:** Avoid extra API call on every editor open; resolved config is informational/debugging, not required for saving  
**Impact:** Fewer API calls; better perceived performance on page load  

## 2026-02-27: API Types Consolidated in api.ts

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**What:** All new interfaces (`Subtenant`, `Agent`, `AgentConfig`, `ResolvedAgentConfig`, etc.) added to bottom of `portal/src/lib/api.ts` (not separate file)  
**Why:** Single source of truth for API contracts; consistent with existing pattern  
**Impact:** Easier to maintain API contracts; import from one file  

## 2026-02-27: API Keys Agent Selector Required

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**What:** ApiKeysPage now requires agent selection in create form. If no agents exist, create button disabled with message "Create an agent first before generating API keys". API call updated: `{ name: string; agentId: string }`.  
**Why:** Product enforces agent_id NOT NULL; every API key must be bound to an agent  
**Impact:** Users cannot create API keys without an agent; clear error messaging  

## 2026-02-27: Analytics Rollup Scope Selector

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**What:** AnalyticsPage new "Scope" dropdown: "All — roll up subtenants + agents" (default, `rollup=true`) vs. "This org only" (no param). All three fetch functions append `?rollup=true` when selected. Component remounted (via `key` change) on scope toggle.  
**Why:** Parent tenant operators need to see rolled-up metrics; scope toggle is a natural UX pattern  
**Impact:** Analytics correctly reflects scope; component remount ensures clean fetch on scope change  

## 2026-02-27: Settings Page Renamed to Org Defaults

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**What:** SettingsPage title: "Provider settings" → "Org Defaults". Subtitle clarifies defaults are inherited by agents. Note added: "These settings are inherited by all agents in this org unless the agent defines its own."  
**Why:** Clarify relationship between org-level defaults and agent-level overrides  
**Impact:** User understanding of inheritance model improved  

## 2026-02-26T16:52:15Z: User directive — Commit After Every Major Update

**By:** Michael Brown (via Copilot)  
**What:** Commit and push after every major update going forward  
**Why:** User request — establish commit-after-every-major-update practice for team continuity  
**Impact:** Coordinator will commit/push after every agent batch; session logs capture decision context; team maintains living decision history

## 2026-02-24T02:33:16.822Z: Tech Stack

**By:** Michael Brown  
**What:** Node.js + TypeScript for Loom implementation  
**Why:** User decision during team setup  
**Impact:** All code will be TypeScript-first

## 2026-02-24T02:33:16.822Z: Phase 1 Scope

**By:** Michael Brown (via PRD)  
**What:** Phase 1 focuses on Gateway (Auditability Foundation) — OpenAI-compatible proxy, streaming support, structured trace recording, token/cost/latency tracking, multi-tenant architecture, minimal observability dashboard  
**Why:** PRD defines phased rollout; Phase 1 establishes audit foundation before governance layer  
**Impact:** Team will defer A/B testing, policy enforcement, memory abstraction, agent orchestration, PII detection, and budget controls to Phase 2+

## 2026-02-24T02:33:16.822Z: Architecture Discussion Required

**By:** Michael Brown  
**What:** Hold architecture conversation before building  
**Why:** User requested architecture discussion before implementation  
**Impact:** Keaton will facilitate design meeting to align on gateway architecture, trace schema, and multi-tenant design before Fenster/McManus start building

## 2026-02-24T02:47:45Z: Architecture Constraints

**By:** Michael Brown (via Copilot)  
**What:** Multi-provider Phase 1 (Azure OpenAI + OpenAI), full body storage enabled, single process topology, 1000 req/sec capacity target  
**Why:** User decisions during architecture discussion — Azure for free testing tokens, auditability requires full bodies, pragmatic Phase 1 scope  
**Impact:** Provider abstraction supports both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI; trace schema stores complete request/response bodies in JSONB; single Fastify process hosts gateway and dashboard; performance validation at 1000 req/sec

## 2026-02-24: Architecture Approved — Loom Phase 1 (Gateway/Auditability Foundation)

**By:** Keaton (Lead), approved by Michael Brown  
**What:** Complete architecture for Phase 1 including Fastify gateway, multi-provider support (OpenAI + Azure OpenAI), SSE streaming with transform stream tee, PostgreSQL with JSONB traces (partitioned by month), API key-based multi-tenant isolation, 3-6ms overhead target, REST dashboard API  
**Why:** Addresses all open questions, validated for 1000 req/sec, balances auditability needs with performance  
**Impact:** Defines work breakdown for Fenster (10 backend items), McManus (5 frontend items), Hockney (7 test items); establishes critical path through F1→F4→F6→F7→H6; locks architecture for Wave 1-4 execution

## 2026-02-24: Provider Abstraction Pattern

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**What:** Implemented provider abstraction using BaseProvider abstract class with shared authentication logic and provider-specific proxy implementations using undici HTTP client  
**Why:** Need consistent interface for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI initially, more later)  
**Impact:** Easy to add new providers by extending BaseProvider; consistent error handling; stream and non-stream responses handled uniformly; provider configuration encapsulated

## 2026-02-24: Database Partitioning Strategy

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**What:** PostgreSQL native table partitioning for traces table by month on created_at column; 4 initial monthly partitions; indexes inherited automatically  
**Why:** Traces table will grow rapidly (1000 req/sec = ~2.6M req/day); need efficient querying and retention management  
**Impact:** Query performance via partition pruning; retention via dropping old month partitions; faster VACUUM/ANALYZE on smaller partitions; independent archival per month

## 2026-02-24: Database Tests Skip-by-Default Pattern

**By:** Hockney (Tester)  
**What:** Database tests skip by default, require explicit TEST_DB_ENABLED=1 environment variable to run  
**Why:** Improve developer experience — tests work immediately after npm install without PostgreSQL dependency  
**Impact:** Mock server tests (6 tests, 520ms) provide immediate validation; database fixture tests validate schema when PostgreSQL available; CI can enable selectively

## 2026-02-24: Test Framework — Vitest

**By:** Hockney (Tester)  
**What:** Selected Vitest over Jest for test infrastructure  
**Why:** Native ESM support aligns with project's "type": "module"; faster execution; better Node.js compatibility; Vite ecosystem consistency  
**Impact:** All future tests use Vitest; test command is npm test; Fenster and McManus should use Vitest for their test suites

## 2026-02-24: Dashboard Architecture — React + Vite SPA

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**What:** Implemented observability dashboard as React 19 + Vite SPA in dashboard/ subdirectory, served by Fastify at /dashboard via @fastify/static plugin  
**Why:** Fast development, modern tooling, TypeScript support; SPA architecture with client-side routing; keeps frontend code isolated  
**Impact:** Build output at dashboard/dist/ served statically; base path /dashboard/ configured; routes for Traces and Analytics; ready for REST API consumption in Wave 3

## 2026-02-24: Security Architecture — Tenant Data Encryption-at-Rest

**By:** Keaton (Lead), approved by Michael Brown  
**What:** Use encryption-at-rest for all tenant data in PostgreSQL (request_body and response_body columns). Application-level AES-256-GCM encryption with per-tenant key derivation. Dashboard analytics lag is acceptable for Phase 1 observability use case.  
**Why:** Protect against unauthorized database console access (insider threat, compromised admin credentials). Phase 1 threat model focuses on DB access boundary; full KMS migration deferred to Phase 2.  
**Impact:** Fenster adds encryption utility module and IV columns to traces migration; Hockney adds encrypted storage validation tests; schema includes encryption_key_version column for Phase 2 key rotation; key management strategy documented for GA compliance planning. Performance impact negligible (<0.01ms per trace encryption). No blockers identified.  
**Alternatives Considered:** PostgreSQL TDE (rejected: all-or-nothing, limited tenant isolation); no encryption + access controls (rejected: fails threat model); selective field encryption (rejected: complex PII detection logic).  
**Risk:** LOW. Standard encryption pattern, negligible performance impact, proven libraries.  
**Deferred to Phase 2:** External KMS integration, key rotation implementation, PII detection layer, ETL pipeline for real-time analytics.

## 2026-02-24: F3 — Tenant Auth Middleware: SHA-256 (not bcrypt)

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**What:** API key validation uses SHA-256 for hashing; LRU cache implemented with JavaScript Map (no external library); cache key = SHA-256 hash of raw API key; tenant provider_config nullable JSONB  
**Why:** bcrypt is intentionally slow (incompatible with 20ms overhead budget). SHA-256 sufficient for opaque random tokens; brute-force resistance from entropy. Map maintains insertion order for LRU eviction. Avoids storing raw keys in memory. Nullable config allows gradual rollout without backfill.  
**Impact:** Fast key validation in hot path; zero new dependencies; DB lookup and cache use same hash function; tenants without provider config can use global env defaults

## 2026-02-24: F5 — Azure OpenAI Adapter: api-key header strategy

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**What:** Azure authentication uses `api-key: <key>` header (not Authorization Bearer); error mapping at adapter boundary; only `x-request-id` forwarded as pass-through header  
**Why:** Azure OpenAI requires `api-key` per Microsoft docs; Bearer returns 401. Consistent error shape simplifies gateway. Forward only safe headers to avoid leaking internal metadata.  
**Impact:** Callers see unified error responses; Azure-specific quirks encapsulated; upstream header leakage prevented

## 2026-02-24: F6 — SSE Streaming Proxy: Transform stream design

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**What:** Push data before parse to minimize latency; onComplete in flush() not on [DONE] sentinel; Node.js Transform stream (not Web TransformStream)  
**Why:** Early push ensures client receives bytes immediately. flush() fires on upstream EOF regardless of [DONE] presence (robust to provider quirks). Node.js Transform avoids type adaptation overhead with undici Readable.  
**Impact:** Low-latency streaming; robust to provider edge cases; native Fastify integration

## 2026-02-24: H2 — Proxy Tests: Direct provider testing

**By:** Hockney (Tester)  
**What:** Test OpenAIProvider.proxy() directly instead of full gateway; gateway integration tests deferred until Fenster adds OPENAI_BASE_URL support  
**Why:** Fastify gateway cannot redirect to mock server without env var support from backend. Provider class IS the proxy mechanism.  
**Impact:** Proxy correctness validation complete (12 tests); gateway integration tests follow as F6+ follow-up

## 2026-02-24: H3 — Auth Tests: Inline reference implementation

**By:** Hockney (Tester)  
**What:** Implement reference Fastify gateway in tests/auth.test.ts mirroring expected auth contract; import swapped to src/auth.ts when Fenster ships  
**Why:** Contract well-understood (Bearer token, x-api-key, LRU, 401 on invalid). Tests document interface; immediate value; all assertions must pass once real module ships.  
**Impact:** Auth contract validated; 16 tests passing; zero flaky imports; seamless upgrade path to Fenster's F3

## 2026-02-24: H5 — Multi-Provider Streaming: Async iteration pattern

**By:** Hockney (Tester)  
**What:** All streaming test helpers use `for await...of` (async iteration protocol), not Web ReadableStream API  
**Why:** undici response.body is Node.js Readable; .getReader() fails on Node 25+. Async iteration works for Node Readable, Web ReadableStream, any async iterable.  
**Impact:** Canonical streaming test pattern for codebase; 33 multi-provider streaming tests passing; future proof

## 2026-02-24: Wave 2 Test Infrastructure — Port range 3011–3040

**By:** Hockney (Tester)  
**What:** Wave 2 test mock servers use ports 3011–3040 (existing mocks at 3001–3002); future waves continue upward (3041+)  
**Why:** Avoid port conflicts in parallel test runs  
**Impact:** 61 tests can run in parallel; scalable port allocation for future waves

## 2026-02-24: F7 — Trace Recording & Persistence

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**Issue:** #4  
**Decisions:**
1. **JSONB Column Storage** — Encrypted ciphertext (hex) stored as PostgreSQL JSONB scalar string via `to_jsonb($1::text)`. Avoids breaking ALTER TABLE while keeping schema consistent. Decryption: read JSONB string → JSON.parse → decrypt hex.
2. **IV Columns** — `request_iv varchar(24)` and `response_iv varchar(24)` added via migration 1000000000005. Nullable for backward compatibility; all new inserts populate both.
3. **Migration Numbering** — Used 1000000000005 (sequential after 1000000000004, which was taken by `add-tenant-provider-config.cjs`).
4. **Batch Flushing** — `this.batch.splice(0)` atomically drains batch before async DB writes. Any `record()` calls during flush land in fresh array, caught by next flush (prevents data loss).
5. **Timer Management** — 5-second setInterval is `unref()`'d to prevent test hangs (process can exit cleanly during vitest runs).
6. **Streaming Integration** — `traceContext` passed as optional field on `StreamProxyOptions` rather than re-architecting provider layer. `index.ts` populates when `request.tenant` available.

**Impact:** Encryption-at-rest foundation complete; streaming traces captured without provider awareness; batch atomicity prevents data loss.

## 2026-02-24: F8 — Analytics Engine Cost Calculation Strategy

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**Issue:** #5  
**Decision:** Inline SQL CASE expressions for cost estimation rather than application-layer model map.

**What:** Cost rates embedded as SQL CASE expressions using `ILIKE '%gpt-3.5%' OR ILIKE '%gpt-35%'` pattern matching, defaulting to GPT-4o rates for all other models.

**Why:** Single DB round trip computes all analytics in one query. No need to pull raw token rows into application memory. Supports new models automatically (falls back to GPT-4o rates). ILIKE covers both OpenAI (`gpt-3.5-turbo`) and Azure (`gpt-35-turbo`) model name variants.

**Rates (per token):**
- GPT-4o input: $0.000005, output: $0.000015
- GPT-3.5 input: $0.0000005, output: $0.0000015

**Impact:** All analytics queries complete in a single SQL call. Cost estimation available on any model without code changes; unknown models default to GPT-4o rates (conservative estimate).

## 2026-02-24: F9 — Dashboard API: Cursor Pagination

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**Issue:** #6  
**Decision:** Cursor pagination uses `created_at` ISO timestamp as the cursor value.

**What:** `GET /v1/traces?cursor={ISO_timestamp}` filters `created_at < cursor` ordered by `created_at DESC`. `nextCursor` is `null` when fewer than `limit` rows are returned.

**Why:** Offset pagination breaks under concurrent inserts (rows shift). Timestamp cursor is stable, human-readable, and maps directly to the existing `idx_traces_tenant_created` composite index. Limit capped at 200 rows per page to avoid unbounded queries.

**Impact:** Efficient paginated listing; no offset calculation; consistent results under write load.

## 2026-02-24: F9 — Dashboard Routes Registered via Plugin

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**Issue:** #6  
**Decision:** Dashboard routes registered via `fastify.register(registerDashboardRoutes)` — not inline in index.ts.

**Why:** Keeps index.ts focused on server bootstrap. Routes encapsulated in `src/routes/dashboard.ts` are independently testable. Auth middleware already applied globally via `addHook('preHandler')` — no extra auth wiring needed per route.

**Impact:** Clean separation of concerns; dashboard routes independently testable; global auth inheritance.

## 2026-02-24: F10 — Provider Registry: Per-Tenant Lazy Cache

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**Issue:** #7  
**Decision:** Module-level `Map<tenantId, BaseProvider>` for instance caching. No TTL; `evictProvider()` exposed for manual invalidation.

**What:** `getProviderForTenant(tenantCtx)` checks the module-level cache before constructing a new provider. Azure provider uses `tenantCtx.providerConfig.baseUrl` as the Azure endpoint and `deployment`/`apiVersion` from the same config.

**Why:** Provider construction is cheap but avoids object churn on every request. No TTL needed in Phase 1 — provider config changes are rare. `evictProvider()` provides an escape hatch when config changes without server restart.

**Impact:** Provider selection is O(1) on the hot path. Falls back to OpenAI + `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var when no `providerConfig` is set (backwards-compatible with existing deployments).

## 2026-02-24: Schema Addition: `status_code` column on `traces`

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**Issue:** #7  
**Decision:** Added `status_code smallint NULL` via migration `1000000000006`.

**Why:** F9 trace listing spec requires `status_code` in responses. `TraceInput` already carried an optional `statusCode` field but it was not persisted. Migration adds the column; `tracing.ts` INSERT updated to include it.

**Impact:** HTTP status codes tracked per trace; analytics dashboard can filter/display by response status; migration maintains backward compatibility (nullable column).

## 2026-02-24: H4 — Multi-Tenant Isolation Tests

**By:** Hockney (Tester)  
**Issue:** #14  
**Decisions:**
1. **fastify.inject() for Auth Tests** — Use Fastify's built-in `inject()` method for testing `registerAuthMiddleware` instead of binding to a real port. Avoids port allocation and bind-race conditions; tests are synchronous and isolated; no network stack overhead.
2. **Mocked pg.Pool** — Pass a `{ query: vi.fn() }` object as the `pg.Pool` argument to `registerAuthMiddleware`. No real PostgreSQL required; mock returns tenant fixtures keyed by SHA-256 hash of API key.
3. **Inactive Tenant Behavior (Deferred)** — Current behavior for deleted/inactive tenants is 401 (DB returns 0 rows, middleware has no 403 path). Future work: add `tenants.active` column, filter in query, return 403 for inactive tenants.

**Impact:** Auth and multi-tenant tests run in-process without any port conflicts; consistent with Wave 3 additions; test documents current behavior with TODO for Phase 2.

## 2026-02-24: H6 — Streaming + Trace Recording Tests

**By:** Hockney (Tester)  
**Issue:** #16  
**Decisions:**
1. **vi.mock + importOriginal Pattern** — Mock `src/tracing.js` using `importOriginal` — preserves the real `TraceRecorder` class while replacing the exported `traceRecorder` singleton with a spy object. SSE proxy tests need to spy on `traceRecorder.record()` (the singleton); batch/timer tests need the real class instantiated fresh per test.
2. **Single Mock for Dual Purpose** — Real class gets real encryption + real db.js mock for flush tests; single mock declaration serves all test suites.

**Impact:** Streaming integrity validated; batch flush timing confirmed; fire-and-forget trace recording during streaming verified; tests are maintainable and independent.

## 2026-02-24: H7 — Encryption-at-Rest Tests

**By:** Hockney (Tester)  
**Issue:** #17  
**Decisions:**
1. **INSERT Parameter Index Constants** — Document the positional SQL parameter indices (`IDX` object) at the top of `encryption-at-rest.test.ts`. TraceRecorder's INSERT uses 13 positional params; magic numbers in assertions are unmaintainable. If Fenster reorders INSERT params, tests fail loudly at the index documentation layer, not silently.

**Impact:** Per-tenant key derivation validated; unique IVs per trace confirmed; AES-256-GCM success and failure modes thoroughly tested.

## 2026-02-24: H4/H6/H7 — Wave 3 Test Infrastructure Port Allocation

**By:** Hockney (Tester)  
**Issues:** #14, #16, #17  
**Decision:** Wave 3 tests (H4, H6, H7) use `fastify.inject()` exclusively — no ports allocated.

**Why:** All three test suites test in-process behavior; no mock HTTP servers needed.

**Impact:** No port conflicts; Wave 3 port range (3041+) remains available for future integration test suites; 85 tests passing with 100% pass rate.

## 2026-02-24: M2 — Traces Table: Infinite Scroll & Client-Side Filtering

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**Issue:** #8  
**Decisions:**
1. **IntersectionObserver Pagination** — Infinite scroll uses an `IntersectionObserver` on a sentinel `<div>` below the table with `rootMargin: 200px`. When the sentinel enters the viewport, the next page is fetched using `nextCursor` from the last API response.
2. **Client-Side Filtering** — Model and status filters in TracesTable operate on the client-side set of loaded traces (up to 50 per page). The `/v1/traces` API does not expose filter query params. Acceptable for Phase 1 volume — revisit if server-side filtering is needed at scale.

**Impact:** Seamless infinite scroll UX; client-side filters enable rapid iteration; deferred server-side filtering to Phase 2 when volume demands optimization.

## 2026-02-24: M3 — Trace Details: Encrypted Body Placeholder

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**Issue:** #9  
**Decision:** Request and response bodies are displayed as "🔒 Encrypted (stored securely)" per the security architecture decision (AES-256-GCM encryption at rest). Bodies are not returned by the dashboard API.

**Why:** Aligns with encryption-at-rest design; prevents accidental plaintext leakage through dashboard; phase 1 focuses on auditability metadata (tokens, latency, cost) rather than request/response inspection.

**Impact:** Users see explicit security indicator; no accidental exposure of encrypted data through UI; database remains the trust boundary.

## 2026-02-24: M4 — Analytics Summary: Time Window State Management

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**Issue:** #10  
**Decision:** The time window selector (1h/6h/24h/7d) lives in `AnalyticsPage` and is passed as a prop to both `AnalyticsSummary` and `TimeseriesCharts`. This keeps both components in sync without extra state management overhead.

**Impact:** Single source of truth for time window; both summary cards and charts reflect selected window; no state synchronization bugs.

## 2026-02-24: M5 — Timeseries Charts: recharts AreaChart with Auto-Bucketing

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**Issue:** #11  
**Decisions:**
1. **recharts AreaChart** — Used `recharts` (added to `dashboard/package.json`) with `AreaChart` + `ResponsiveContainer` for both charts. Responsive by default.
2. **Time-Aware Bucketing** — Bucket size derived from selected time window: 1h→5min, 6h→30min, 24h→60min, 7d→360min. Ensures chart readability across all time scales.

**Impact:** Production-ready timeseries visualization; responsive design works on all devices; automatic bucketing prevents over-plotting at different scales.

## 2026-02-24: M2–M5 — Frontend API Integration: localStorage API Key

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**Issues:** #8–#11  
**Decision:** API key stored in `localStorage` under key `loom_api_key`. Prompted via modal overlay on first visit (or if key is missing). Simple and sufficient for Phase 1; no server-side session needed.

**Why:** Eliminates multi-step auth flow; API key naturally scoped to browser origin; localStorage persists across sessions without server state.

**Impact:** Users provide API key once per device/browser; dashboard automatically includes key in Authorization header for all API requests; no session backend required for Phase 1.

## 2026-02-24: M3 — Trace Details: Estimated Cost Calculation (Rough)

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**Issue:** #9  
**Decision:** TraceDetails shows estimated cost using: `(promptTokens * 0.01 + completionTokens * 0.03) / 1000`. This is GPT-4-class pricing approximation. The actual cost is not returned by `/v1/traces`. Should be replaced with real cost data when the API adds it.

**Why:** Provides visibility into cost implications during Phase 1; approximation acceptable when actual costs not available.

**Impact:** Users see cost estimates in trace details; Phase 2 API enhancement will replace with real cost from backend analytics engine.

## 2026-02-25: F — Instrumentation: TTFB + Gateway Overhead Metrics

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Status:** Implemented

**What:** Wired `ttfb_ms` and `gateway_overhead_ms` columns (pre-existing in DB schema) into the full request lifecycle — from capture through trace recording to dashboard API response.

**Metrics Defined:**
- `ttfb_ms` — Elapsed ms from gateway start to first SSE byte (for non-streaming: equals latency_ms)
- `gateway_overhead_ms` — Pre-LLM gateway work time (auth, routing, parsing, provider selection)

**Changes Made:**
- `src/tracing.ts` — Added `ttfbMs` and `gatewayOverheadMs` to `TraceInput` and `BatchRow` interfaces; updated INSERT to 16 positional params
- `src/streaming.ts` — Captures `firstChunkMs` on first SSE byte; computes `ttfbMs` (firstChunk - start) and `gatewayOverheadMs` (upstreamStart - start) in flush()
- `src/index.ts` — Records `upstreamStartMs` immediately before provider.proxy(); passes to streaming context; added non-streaming trace recording with latency metrics
- `src/routes/dashboard.ts` — Added both fields to cursor and non-cursor trace listing SELECT queries

**Why:** Phase 1 latency observability requires visibility into both time-to-first-token and gateway processing overhead. No schema migration needed — columns already existed.

**Impact:** Backend trace system now emits complete latency breakdown; dashboard API returns both metrics per trace; frontend can display granular latency insights.

## 2026-02-25: M — Dashboard Display: TTFB + Overhead Visibility

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Status:** Implemented

**What:** Surfaced `ttfb_ms` and `gateway_overhead_ms` in TracesTable and TraceDetails views.

**Changes Made:**
- `dashboard/src/components/TracesTable.tsx` — Updated `Trace` interface; added "Overhead" and "TTFB" columns after Latency, before Tokens (null-safe rendering)
- `dashboard/src/components/TraceDetails.tsx` — Added `<dt>`/`<dd>` pairs for both metrics with inline italic hints
- `dashboard/src/components/TraceDetails.css` — Added `.field-hint` style for inline label explanations

**Column Format:** `Xms` or `—` if null (backward compatible with older traces)

**Why:** Users need latency breakdown to diagnose performance bottlenecks. Inline hints improve accessibility over hover-only tooltips.

**Impact:** Latency observability complete end-to-end; users can distinguish gateway overhead from LLM response time; Phase 1 observability goals achieved.

## 2026-02-25: Startup Environment Variable Validation

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Status:** Implemented

**What:** Added boot-time validation for `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY` environment variable in `src/index.ts`. If missing, gateway logs a warning to stderr but continues startup.

**Why:** Trace recording silently fails when `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY` is missing (errors are caught and swallowed in `tracing.ts`). Operators discover the misconfiguration only after noticing missing traces (hours or days later). Boot-time warnings surface configuration issues immediately during startup.

**Implementation:** Added check after dotenv import that warns if `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY` is not set.

**Pattern:** Fail-fast on config, fail-soft on runtime — configuration validation should be loud and early (boot time); runtime errors in non-critical paths (like trace recording) can be swallowed to avoid cascading failures; misconfiguration should never be silent at startup.

**Impact:** Operators see immediate feedback when required env vars are missing; gateway remains operational for proxying even without trace recording (graceful degradation); no breaking changes to existing deployments.

**Future Consideration:** This pattern could be extended to validate other critical env vars at boot time (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, provider API keys).

## 2026-02-25: Schema Decisions: Multi-Tenant Management Migrations

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Migrations:** F-MT1 (1000000000007), F-MT2 (1000000000008)

**Decision 1: varchar(20) for Status Columns (Not PostgreSQL ENUMs)**

Both `tenants.status` and `api_keys.status` use `varchar(20)` with application-enforced valid values rather than PostgreSQL `ENUM` types.

**Why:** Adding new enum values to PostgreSQL ENUMs requires `ALTER TYPE` which locks the table. varchar allows adding new status values (e.g., `suspended`, `pending`) without schema migrations. Application layer can enforce validation via constants/types. Simpler rollback story (down migration just drops columns).

**Valid Values:** `tenants.status`: `active`, `inactive`; `api_keys.status`: `active`, `revoked`

**Impact:** Future status expansion doesn't require coordinated migrations; application code owns the enum contract.

**Decision 2: Nullable `revoked_at` vs Boolean `is_revoked`**

`api_keys.revoked_at` is a nullable `timestamptz` rather than a boolean flag.

**Why:** Tracks **when** the key was revoked (audit requirement). Can distinguish "never revoked" (NULL) from "revoked at time X". Single column serves both status indicator and timestamp purposes. Pairs with `status` column for filtering (`WHERE status = 'active'` is faster than `WHERE revoked_at IS NULL`).

**Impact:** Future audit queries can answer "how long was this key active?" without additional columns.

**Decision 3: Empty String Default for `key_prefix`**

`api_keys.key_prefix` defaults to empty string (`''`) rather than NULL.

**Why:** Simplifies UI rendering (no null checks needed in frontend). Key prefix is optional but when populated should always be a string. Empty string vs NULL distinction unnecessary for this field. NOT NULL + default empty avoids null handling in application layer.

**Impact:** Cleaner TypeScript types (`string` not `string | null`); fewer edge cases in dashboard.

**Decision 4: Automatic Backfill via DEFAULT Values**

Both migrations use `DEFAULT` clauses to backfill existing rows automatically during `ALTER TABLE`.

**Why:** Existing tenants get `status = 'active'`, `updated_at = now()` without separate UPDATE statements. Existing api_keys get `name = 'Default Key'`, `key_prefix = ''`, `status = 'active'` atomically. Single DDL statement (faster, less lock time). Idempotent migration (re-running doesn't duplicate backfill logic).

**Impact:** Zero-downtime migrations on existing data; no multi-step migration coordination needed.

**Decision 5: Index on Status Columns**

Both `tenants.status` and `api_keys.status` have dedicated indexes.

**Why:** Common query pattern: filter by status (`WHERE status = 'active'`). Low cardinality (2-3 values) but high selectivity (most rows are `active`). Supports dashboard queries that list active tenants or active keys. Index overhead minimal (single column, small data type).

**Impact:** Fast status-based filtering; supports future admin UI for tenant/key management.

## 2026-02-25: Multi-Tenant Management Design — Approved

**By:** Keaton (Lead), revised per Michael Brown's decisions (Q1–Q4)  
**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Status:** Revised design incorporating all open questions resolved — ready for implementation

**Scope:** Phase 1 operational multi-tenancy (tenant CRUD, API key management, provider config management, dashboard admin interface)

**Key Decisions:**

1. **Q1 — Admin Auth (Per-User, Not Shared Secret):** New `admin_users` table (id, username, password_hash, created_at, last_login). `POST /v1/admin/login` endpoint validates bcrypt hash, returns 8h JWT (HS256, signed with `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` env var). Admin auth middleware on all `/v1/admin/*` routes. Seed script (`scripts/create-admin.js`) for initial admin user creation. Dashboard stores JWT in `localStorage['loom_admin_token']`.

2. **Q2 — Deletion Strategy (Soft Default + Hard Delete Option):** Soft delete (default) via `PATCH /v1/admin/tenants/:id` with `status: "inactive"`. Hard delete via `DELETE /v1/admin/tenants/:id?confirm=true` — cascades through api_keys, traces, provider_config. API key soft revoke via `DELETE /v1/admin/tenants/:id/api-keys/:keyId` (sets status=revoked, revoked_at=now()). API key hard delete via `DELETE /v1/admin/tenants/:id/api-keys/:keyId?permanent=true`. Confirmation query params required on all destructive operations.

3. **Q3 — Provider Config Encryption (AES-256-GCM at Rest):** Reuses `src/encryption.ts` pattern (ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY + HMAC-SHA256 per-tenant key derivation). Provider `apiKey` encrypted before storing in `provider_config` JSONB column. Decrypted on read in `registry.ts` before passing to provider constructor. GET responses return `hasApiKey: boolean` — never raw or encrypted key.

4. **Q4 — Existing Data Backfill (Confirmed):** Migration defaults handle backfill for existing tenant and API keys. No additional migration logic needed — already designed correctly.

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /v1/admin/login` — Public, no auth required. Returns JWT.
- `POST /v1/admin/tenants` — Create tenant
- `GET /v1/admin/tenants` — List all (paginated, filterable by status)
- `GET /v1/admin/tenants/:id` — Get tenant with provider config summary (keys redacted)
- `PATCH /v1/admin/tenants/:id` — Update name or status
- `DELETE /v1/admin/tenants/:id?confirm=true` — Hard delete with cascade
- `PUT /v1/admin/tenants/:id/provider-config` — Set/update provider config (encrypts apiKey at write)
- `DELETE /v1/admin/tenants/:id/provider-config` — Remove provider config
- `POST /v1/admin/tenants/:id/api-keys` — Create API key (raw key shown once)
- `GET /v1/admin/tenants/:id/api-keys` — List keys (no raw key/hash returned)
- `DELETE /v1/admin/tenants/:id/api-keys/:keyId` — Soft revoke (default)
- `DELETE /v1/admin/tenants/:id/api-keys/:keyId?permanent=true` — Hard delete

**Auth Middleware Update:** Skip `/v1/admin` routes in the tenant API key auth preHandler. Admin routes use dedicated JWT auth preHandler.

**DB Schema Migrations:**
- **F-MT1 (1000000000007):** `ALTER TABLE tenants ADD status varchar(20) DEFAULT 'active', ADD updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(); CREATE INDEX idx_tenants_status ON tenants (status);`
- **F-MT2 (1000000000008):** `ALTER TABLE api_keys ADD name varchar(255) DEFAULT 'Default Key', ADD key_prefix varchar(20) DEFAULT '', ADD status varchar(20) DEFAULT 'active', ADD revoked_at timestamptz; CREATE INDEX idx_api_keys_status ON api_keys (status);`
- **F-MT4a (1000000000009):** `CREATE TABLE admin_users (id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(), username varchar(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL, password_hash varchar(255) NOT NULL, created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(), last_login timestamptz);`

**Frontend Strategy:** Dedicated `/admin` page (not multi-tenant tenant switcher). Admin uses JWT auth via form login. Existing Traces/Analytics pages continue per-tenant (API key scope). Admin UI components: AdminLoginForm, TenantsList, TenantDetail (with provider config and API key management), CreateTenantModal, ProviderConfigForm, ApiKeysTable, CreateApiKeyModal.

**New Environment Variables:**
- `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` — HS256 signing key for admin JWT tokens (required for startup if admin routes enabled)
- `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY` — Already exists, reused for provider config encryption

**Why:** Addresses all Phase 1 operational multi-tenancy requirements. Per-user admin auth more secure than shared secret. Soft delete allows graceful deactivation; hard delete supports GDPR compliance. Provider key encryption consistent with existing encryption-at-rest architecture. Zero-downtime migrations via DEFAULT backfill.

**Impact:** Defines complete backend (F-MT1 through F-MT8) and frontend (M-MT1 through M-MT6) work breakdown for multi-tenant Wave (4 waves, critical path F-MT4a → F-MT4b → F-MT5 → F-MT8). Locks API surface and schema for Wave execution. Establishes admin/operator interface separate from tenant observability interface. No blockers identified; ready for implementation.

**Deferred to Phase 2:** RBAC per admin user, tenant self-service registration, audit logging for admin actions, rate limiting per tenant, multi-region routing.

## 2026-02-25: F-MT3/F-MT4a — Auth Middleware Enhancement & Admin Users Table

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Status:** Complete  
**Tasks:** F-MT3 (Auth Middleware), F-MT4a (Admin Users Migration)

**Decisions:**

1. **Admin Users Table:** New migration 1000000000009 creates `admin_users` table with per-user credentials (username, password_hash, created_at, last_login). Password hashing uses Node.js built-in `crypto.scrypt` (salt:derivedKey format) to avoid new dependencies. Migration seeds default admin user from env vars with idempotent `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.

2. **Auth Middleware Query Enhancement:** Updated `lookupTenant()` in `src/auth.ts` to filter on `ak.status = 'active'` AND `t.status = 'active'`. Revoked keys and inactive tenants immediately rejected (no cache race conditions).

3. **Cache Invalidation Helpers:** Exported `invalidateCachedKey(keyHash)` for single key invalidation and `invalidateAllKeysForTenant(tenantId, pool)` for bulk invalidation on tenant deactivation. Bridges gap between management APIs (key ID) and cache layer (key hash).

**Why:** Foundation for JWT-based admin auth (F-MT4b). Enables safe deactivation of tenants/keys without lingering cache entries. No bcrypt dependency needed (Phase 1 constraint).

**Impact:** F-MT5–F-MT7 endpoints can safely invalidate caches. Auth tests (H-MT5) can validate revoked/inactive scenarios. Clean separation of concerns (auth.ts is responsible for its own cache invalidation).

## 2026-02-25: F-MT4b — JWT-Based Admin Authentication

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Status:** Complete  
**Task:** F-MT4b (JWT login endpoint, middleware, route scaffold)

**Decisions:**

1. **@fastify/jwt Integration:** Admin auth uses `@fastify/jwt` plugin (not jsonwebtoken) for native Fastify request/reply lifecycle integration. HS256-signed JWT with 8-hour expiry. `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` env var required (warns at startup if missing).

2. **Login Endpoint:** `POST /v1/admin/login` accepts `{ username, password }`, verifies against `admin_users.password_hash` using same scrypt format as migration, returns `{ token, username }` on success, 401 on failure. Updates `last_login` timestamp.

3. **Admin Auth Middleware:** `src/middleware/adminAuth.ts` verifies Bearer tokens, attaches `request.adminUser` to request. All admin routes (except login) use this middleware via preHandler.

4. **Route Scaffold:** All 10 admin routes registered with 501 stubs (tenant CRUD 5, API key 3, provider config 2). Establishes API surface contract immediately — 501 clearly indicates "not implemented" vs 404 "doesn't exist".

5. **Auth Domain Separation:** Tenant API key auth and admin JWT auth are orthogonal — no shared middleware. Tenant auth on `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/traces`, `/v1/analytics/*`. Admin auth on `/v1/admin/*`. Skip list in tenant auth prevents conflicts.

**Why:** Per-user admin auth more auditable than shared secret. JWT stateless (no session store). 8-hour expiry balances session longevity (operator convenience) with security (limited token lifetime). Scrypt matches existing password storage (no new crypto dependencies).

**Impact:** Frontend can implement login form + JWT storage. Backend ready for F-MT5–F-MT7 CRUD implementation. Testing can focus on auth contract validation (H-MT1).

## 2026-02-25: F-MT5/F-MT6/F-MT7 — Complete Admin CRUD Implementation

**By:** Fenster (Backend)  
**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Status:** Complete  
**Tasks:** F-MT5 (Tenant CRUD), F-MT6 (API Key Management), F-MT7 (Provider Config)

**Decisions:**

1. **Tenant CRUD Endpoints:**
   - POST /v1/admin/tenants (201 with tenant row)
   - GET /v1/admin/tenants (paginated list with optional status filter, returns { tenants: [...], total })
   - GET /v1/admin/tenants/:id (detail with API key count + provider summary)
   - PATCH /v1/admin/tenants/:id (partial updates: name, status with cache invalidation on status change)
   - DELETE /v1/admin/tenants/:id?confirm=true (hard delete with cascade to api_keys, traces via FK)

2. **Cache Invalidation Workflow:** On PATCH status→inactive or DELETE, call `invalidateAllKeysForTenant()` before DB change. Ensures auth middleware rejects revoked tenant immediately.

3. **API Key Generation:** Format `loom_sk_` + 24-byte base64url (40 chars total, 192-bit entropy). `key_prefix` = first 12 chars (UI display). `key_hash` = SHA-256 hex (auth lookup). Raw key returned ONCE on creation.

4. **API Key Endpoints:**
   - POST /v1/admin/tenants/:id/api-keys (create, returns raw key once)
   - GET /v1/admin/tenants/:id/api-keys (list, no key material exposure)
   - DELETE /v1/admin/tenants/:id/api-keys/:keyId (soft revoke by default, hard delete with ?permanent=true)

5. **Provider Config Encryption:** Reuse `src/encryption.ts` (AES-256-GCM + per-tenant key derivation). Encrypt `apiKey` on write via `encryptTraceBody()`. Decrypt on read in `registry.ts` via `decryptTraceBody()`. GET responses return `hasApiKey: boolean` (never raw/encrypted key).

6. **Provider Config Endpoints:**
   - PUT /v1/admin/tenants/:id/provider-config (set/replace with provider-specific fields: openai/azure/ollama)
   - DELETE /v1/admin/tenants/:id/provider-config (clear config)

7. **Dynamic SQL Parameter Indexing:** PATCH queries with partial updates require careful index tracking (build updates array, push params, track paramIndex, append WHERE). Supports name-only, status-only, or both updates without code duplication.

8. **Parallel Queries:** List endpoint uses `Promise.all()` for tenants + total count (single round-trip, ~50% latency reduction).

**Why:** Complete operational multi-tenancy per Phase 1 scope. Soft delete allows graceful deactivation; hard delete supports GDPR compliance. Encryption consistent with existing architecture (single ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY env var). Parallel queries optimize hot path. Dynamic SQL supports flexible updates.

**Impact:** Frontend can implement full admin UI (M-MT1–M-MT6). All 10 endpoints provide complete tenant lifecycle. Hockney can write integration tests (28 tests, H-MT1–H-MT5). Ready for production deployment.

## 2026-02-25: M-MT1 — Admin API Utility Module & Login Component

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Status:** Complete  
**Task:** M-MT1 (Admin API utilities + AdminLogin component)

**Decisions:**

1. **Admin API Utilities:** New `dashboard/src/utils/adminApi.ts` with `adminFetch()` that auto-redirects to `/dashboard/admin` on 401 or missing token. Token managed in `localStorage['loom_admin_token']`. Export helper functions: `getAdminToken()`, `setAdminToken()`, `clearAdminToken()`.

2. **Type Exports:** Define `AdminTenant`, `AdminApiKey`, `AdminProviderConfig` interfaces (co-located with API module for single import source). Match backend schema with `hasApiKey: boolean` instead of raw/encrypted keys.

3. **AdminLogin Component:** Username + password form, localStorage token persistence (8h lifetime matches backend JWT expiry). Submit disabled until both fields non-empty. Error handling inline (red box below password). Loading state during fetch.

4. **localStorage Strategy:** Persist admin JWT across page reloads + browser restarts (matches 8h session model). Alternative sessionStorage rejected (forces re-login on new tabs, poor UX for multi-tab workflows).

5. **Styling Consistency:** Follow existing `ApiKeyPrompt.css` patterns (overlay, card, input, button, error states). Responsive design inherited from existing components.

**Why:** Standard JWT + localStorage pattern (proven security model). Mirroring existing ApiKeyPrompt reduces design decisions. Co-located types simplify imports. Auto-redirect on 401 centralizes auth failure handling.

**Impact:** Clean foundation for admin UI components (M-MT2+). No custom crypto on frontend (backend signs/verifies JWT). Form handling is simple React state.

## 2026-02-25: M-MT2 — Admin Page Shell & Route Registration

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Status:** Complete  
**Task:** M-MT2 (Admin page shell, /admin route, nav link)

**Decisions:**

1. **AdminPage Component:** Check `localStorage['loom_admin_token']` on mount. If missing, render `<AdminLogin onLogin={callback} />`. If token exists, render admin shell with placeholder + logout button. Logout clears token and resets state (no page reload).

2. **Token-Driven Login/Logout:** State-driven flow (not redirect-based) keeps navigation smooth. AdminLogin handles all auth logic; AdminPage orchestrates flow.

3. **Route Registration:** Added `/admin` route in App.tsx alongside existing `/` (Traces) and `/analytics` routes. No changes to existing routes/components.

4. **Navigation Link:** Added "Admin" link to Layout.tsx navigation bar after "Analytics". Uses same active state detection pattern as existing links.

5. **Placeholder Approach:** Phase 1 renders minimal shell (header + logout button). Real admin UI (tenant list, detail, etc.) implemented in M-MT3+ (blocked on F-MT5 endpoint completion).

**Why:** Token check on mount avoids unnecessary API calls. State-driven flow simplifies component logic. Placeholder unblocks routing integration while backend is being completed. Consistent styling with existing app.

**Impact:** Admin route fully registered and navigable. Auth gate working (login required, logout clears token). Ready for M-MT3+ detail view components.

## 2026-02-25: M-MT3/M-MT4/M-MT5/M-MT6 — Complete Admin Dashboard UI

**By:** McManus (Frontend)  
**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Status:** Complete  
**Tasks:** M-MT3 (TenantsList + CreateTenantModal), M-MT4 (TenantDetail), M-MT5 (ProviderConfigForm), M-MT6 (ApiKeysTable + CreateApiKeyModal)

**Decisions:**

1. **TenantsList Component:**
   - GET /v1/admin/tenants on mount
   - Loading state: 3 skeleton shimmer rows
   - Error state: retry button
   - Empty state: friendly copy
   - Table columns: Name, Status (badge), API Keys (placeholder), Created (formatted date)
   - Row click navigates to detail view (state-based, not URL routing)
   - "New Tenant" button opens CreateTenantModal

2. **CreateTenantModal:**
   - Single text input for tenant name
   - POST /v1/admin/tenants
   - Inline error display on failure
   - Success: calls `onCreated` callback + closes modal
   - Click-outside and Escape dismiss
   - Loading state prevents double-submit

3. **State-Based Navigation:** Use React state (`selectedTenantId`) to switch between list and detail views (not URL routing). Simpler for Phase 1; TenantsList takes `onTenantSelect` prop; TenantDetail takes `onBack` prop.

4. **TenantDetail Component:**
   - GET /v1/admin/tenants/:id on mount
   - Inline name editing (PATCH)
   - Status toggle: "Deactivate" (if active) / "Reactivate" (if inactive)
   - Danger zone: permanent delete with confirmation
   - Renders ProviderConfigForm + ApiKeysTable as sections

5. **ProviderConfigForm:**
   - Display current config (provider, baseUrl, hasApiKey indicator with "🔒 Set (encrypted)")
   - Provider select (openai, azure, ollama)
   - API key field (password input, leave blank on update to keep existing)
   - Azure-specific fields: deployment, apiVersion (conditional rendering)
   - PUT /v1/admin/tenants/:id/provider-config
   - "Remove Config" button with inline confirmation

6. **ApiKeysTable:**
   - List keys: name, prefix, status badge, created/revoked dates
   - "Create API Key" button → opens CreateApiKeyModal
   - "Revoke" button (active keys) → confirmation → soft delete
   - "Delete" button (revoked keys) → permanent delete with ?permanent=true
   - Empty state

7. **CreateApiKeyModal (Two-Stage):**
   - Stage 1: form with key name → POST /v1/admin/tenants/:id/api-keys
   - Stage 2: raw key display with copy button + warning "You won't see this again"
   - Click-outside disabled when key shown (requires explicit "Done")
   - Forces acknowledgment before closing

8. **Confirmation Patterns:**
   - Inline expansion: low-risk operations (provider config delete)
   - In-component warning section: high-impact operations (tenant delete)
   - Browser confirm(): quick actions (API key revoke/delete)
   - Raw key display: explicit acknowledgment required (forced "Done", not "Close")

9. **Type Additions:** Extended `AdminProviderConfig` with optional `deployment?` and `apiVersion?` fields for Azure support.

10. **Modal Styling:** Follow existing patterns (click-outside dismiss, Escape handler, responsive overlays).

**Why:** Complete admin UI per backend API contract. State-based navigation simple for Phase 1 scope. Confirmation patterns match severity of operations. Raw key one-time display + forced acknowledgment is security best practice (GitHub, AWS pattern).

**Impact:** Full admin dashboard functional end-to-end. TenantsList → detail → provider config + API keys all wired. Ready for E2E testing with backend. No URL routing complexity; state management straightforward.

## 2026-02-25: H-MT1 through H-MT5 — 28 Admin Integration Tests

**By:** Hockney (Tester)  
**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Status:** Complete  
**Tasks:** H-MT1–H-MT5 (Admin auth, tenant CRUD, API key management, provider config, auth regression)

**Decisions:**

1. **Test Architecture:** Mocked pg.Pool with 15+ query handlers covering all admin routes + auth middleware. No real PostgreSQL; all tests run in <2s total. In-process testing via fastify.inject() eliminates port allocation flakiness.

2. **Mock Query Coverage:**
   - Admin user login (scrypt password verification)
   - Tenant CRUD with conditional UPDATE (partial updates)
   - API key soft/hard delete with status transitions
   - Provider config encryption/decryption simulation
   - Auth middleware tenant lookup (multi-space SQL formatting)
   - Cache invalidation helper queries (SELECT key_hash by tenant)

3. **Cache Invalidation Discovery:** Auth middleware uses module-level LRU cache singleton persisting across test runs. H-MT5 regression tests initially failed because first test cached values, subsequent tests with modified mock data still read stale cache. **Solution:** Call `invalidateCachedKey()` in beforeEach for H-MT5 suite. **Implication:** Future test authors must explicitly clear cache for auth regression scenarios (not obvious, documented in history).

4. **Test Coverage (28 tests):**
   - H-MT1: Admin auth middleware (6 tests) — JWT verification, bearer tokens, 401 handling
   - H-MT2: Tenant CRUD (10 tests) — create, list, detail, update, delete with cache validation
   - H-MT3: API key management (5 tests) — create, list, soft revoke, hard delete
   - H-MT4: Provider config (4 tests) — CRUD with encryption round-trip
   - H-MT5: Auth regression (3 tests) — revoked keys, inactive tenants, cache invalidation

5. **No Health Check Endpoint Gap Addressed:** Admin routes lack dedicated `/v1/admin/health` endpoint. All routes except login require JWT. **Observation:** No easy smoke test for "is admin API alive?". **Recommendation:** Consider adding health endpoint in Phase 2 for monitoring/load balancer checks.

**Why:** Comprehensive coverage validates entire admin API surface. Mock pg.Pool avoids PostgreSQL dependency. Findings (cache invalidation requirement, health check gap) documented for team learnings.

**Impact:** All 28 tests passing (113 total suite, 100% pass rate). Admin API endpoints ready for production deployment. Cache invalidation behavior well-understood for future work.

## 2026-02-25: Multi-Tenant Admin Feature — Implementation Complete

**By:** Fenster, McManus, Hockney  
**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Status:** Complete  
**Summary:** All Phase 1 multi-tenant management API and admin dashboard UI fully implemented and tested.

**Scope:** 
- Backend: 10 CRUD endpoints (tenant, API key, provider config management)
- Frontend: 6 admin UI components (login, list, detail, config form, key management)
- Tests: 28 integration tests (auth, CRUD, encryption, regression)

**Key Achievements:**
- JWT-based per-user admin authentication (not shared secret)
- Encryption-at-rest for provider API keys (AES-256-GCM + per-tenant derivation)
- Soft-delete by default with hard-delete option (GDPR compliance)
- Cache invalidation helpers for immediate auth rejection on mutations
- State-based navigation in admin dashboard (no URL routing complexity)
- Raw API key display once on creation with forced acknowledgment
- Comprehensive integration test suite with cache invalidation validation

**Build Status:**
- ✅ Backend: Clean compile (npm run build)
- ✅ Frontend: Clean compile (711 modules, 600.82 kB)
- ✅ Tests: All passing (npm test)

**Phase 2 Deferrals:**
- Audit logging per admin action
- RBAC per admin user (read-only, operator, super-admin)
- Tenant usage limits and cost budgets
- API key rotation workflows
- External KMS integration
- Admin health check endpoint

**Ready for:** Production deployment validation, user acceptance testing, integration with existing observability dashboard.

## 2025-07-24: Tenant Portal Architecture Approved

**By:** Keaton (Lead), approved by Michael Brown  
**What:** Complete architecture for tenant self-service portal — separate React SPA (`portal/`), 7 backend routes (`/v1/portal/*`), `tenant_users` table with scrypt passwords, separate JWT namespace (`PORTAL_JWT_SECRET`), provider API key encryption, email-globally-unique design  
**Why:** Phase 1 requires tenant onboarding without admin access; signup/login flows, provider configuration, and API key self-management; email uniqueness simplifies initial implementation  
**Impact:** Defines work breakdown for Fenster (portal backend, migration, auth middleware), McManus (portal React SPA, 6 pages, 4 components); unblocks tenant adoption without admin provisioning; establishes separate auth domain (portal JWT vs admin JWT) for security isolation

## 2025-07-24: Portal Backend Implementation Notes

**By:** Fenster (Backend Dev)  
**What:** Implementation decisions for portal backend: JWT registered at top-level Fastify instance, `registerPortalAuthMiddleware` returns route-level preHandler (not hook), `keyPrefix` = 15 chars (per spec), email stored lowercase at app layer, scrypt format `salt:derivedKey` consistent with admin_users  
**Why:** Ensure JWT availability during route registration, match admin auth pattern, follow Keaton's spec exactly, prevent email case-sensitivity issues  
**Impact:** Portal auth middleware fully isolated from admin auth via Fastify namespace; signup/login endpoints establish email-based identity; rate limiting TODO for future work

## 2025-07-24: Tenant Portal Frontend Decisions

**By:** McManus (Frontend Dev)  
**What:** Design decisions for portal React SPA: color palette matches dashboard (gray-950/900, indigo-600), ApiKeyReveal component reused in both signup and key creation, ProviderConfigForm extracted as reusable component, JWT stored as `loom_portal_token` (separate from `loom_admin_token`), no basename for React Router (portal serves at `/`)  
**Why:** Visual consistency across both SPAs, reduce component duplication, clean auth domain separation, simplify production serving (no path prefix needed)  
**Impact:** Unified Loom UI aesthetic; ApiKeyReveal establishes "show once" pattern for sensitive keys; ProviderConfigForm enables reuse in future admin dashboard; state-based navigation (selectedTenantId) supports scalable admin UI without URL routing complexity

## 2026-02-26: Admin Trace & Analytics Endpoints

**By:** Fenster (Backend Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Date:** 2026-02-26

### Context

The admin dashboard previously had no way to view traces across tenants — `/v1/traces` is scoped to the API key's tenant. Admin operators need visibility into all tenant activity.

### Decisions

**1. Separate admin analytics functions, not overloading existing ones**

`getAnalyticsSummary` and `getTimeseriesMetrics` in `analytics.ts` take a required `tenantId`. Rather than making `tenantId` optional on the existing functions (which could mask callers that accidentally omit it), we added:
- `getAdminAnalyticsSummary(tenantId?: string, windowHours?)`
- `getAdminTimeseriesMetrics(tenantId?: string, windowHours?, bucketMinutes?)`

Per-tenant dashboard routes remain unchanged and continue to pass a required `tenantId`.

**2. Dynamic SQL parameter numbering via `params.push()`**

Admin queries conditionally include a `tenant_id` filter. We use `params.push(value)` inside template literals — `Array.push` returns the new array length, giving us the correct `$N` placeholder inline. Clean and avoids string-splitting logic.

**3. `$1` = `limit` in admin traces query**

The `LIMIT` binding is always `$1` so it appears at the top of the query. All `WHERE` filter params are pushed after, yielding `$2`, `$3` etc. This keeps the query readable and consistent regardless of which filters are active.

**4. Endpoints protected by `adminAuthMiddleware` (JWT)**

All three new endpoints use the `authOpts = { preHandler: adminAuthMiddleware }` pattern already established in `admin.ts`. No API-key auth is involved — these are admin-only surfaces.

### New Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth |
|--------|------|------|
| GET | `/v1/admin/traces` | Admin JWT |
| GET | `/v1/admin/analytics/summary` | Admin JWT |
| GET | `/v1/admin/analytics/timeseries` | Admin JWT |

### Impact

- `src/analytics.ts` — two new exported functions added (non-breaking)
- `src/routes/admin.ts` — three new GET routes, two new imports (`getAdminAnalyticsSummary`, `getAdminTimeseriesMetrics`, `query`)

## 2026-02-26: Admin Dashboard Split — Separate Auth + Tenant Filter

**By:** McManus (Frontend Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Date:** 2026-02-26

### Context

The admin dashboard previously used an API key (stored in `localStorage.loom_api_key`) to call the tenant-scoped `/v1/traces` endpoint. This meant an admin could only see one tenant's data at a time — whichever tenant's API key they had loaded. There was no way to browse across tenants.

Simultaneously, the tenant portal (portal/) had no traces or analytics UI — tenants couldn't see their own request history.

### Decision

**Admin Dashboard:**
- Switch TracesPage and AnalyticsPage from API key auth to admin JWT (`localStorage.loom_admin_token`, managed by `adminApi.ts`)
- Call the new admin endpoints: `/v1/admin/traces`, `/v1/admin/analytics/summary`, `/v1/admin/analytics/timeseries`
- Add a tenant filter dropdown above traces/analytics; fetches tenant list from `/v1/admin/tenants`
- No API key prompt shown for admin dashboard — if admin token missing, show a sign-in link instead

**Portal:**
- Add `/app/traces` → TracesPage (tenant-scoped, JWT auth, calls `/v1/traces`)
- Add `/app/analytics` → AnalyticsPage (tenant-scoped, JWT auth, calls `/v1/analytics/summary` + timeseries)
- Add Traces and Analytics nav links to AppLayout sidebar

### Implementation Pattern

Added `adminMode?: boolean` and `tenantId?: string` props to `TracesTable`, `AnalyticsSummary`, `TimeseriesCharts`. When `adminMode` is true:
- Use `ADMIN_BASE` (from adminApi.ts) instead of `API_BASE`
- Use `adminAuthHeaders()` (Bearer admin JWT) instead of `authHeaders()` (Bearer API key)
- Append `?tenant_id=X` when a tenant is selected

This pattern keeps the component API minimal. The alternative — passing full endpoint URLs and header factories as props — would cause useCallback dependency issues with inline functions.

### Scope Boundaries

- Did **not** build admin analytics charts for per-tenant comparison — deferred to future wave
- Did **not** add real-time refresh to portal traces — not required for Phase 1
- Portal analytics shows a data table (buckets) rather than recharts visualization — portal doesn't have recharts dep; table is sufficient for Phase 1 observability
- Architecture decisions (endpoint shapes, auth model) remain Fenster's domain; this PR purely consumes Fenster's new admin endpoints

### Files Changed

- `dashboard/src/pages/TracesPage.tsx` — admin auth, tenant filter
- `dashboard/src/pages/AnalyticsPage.tsx` — admin auth, tenant filter
- `dashboard/src/components/TracesTable.tsx` — adminMode/tenantId props
- `dashboard/src/components/AnalyticsSummary.tsx` — adminMode/tenantId props
- `dashboard/src/components/TimeseriesCharts.tsx` — adminMode/tenantId props
- `portal/src/pages/TracesPage.tsx` — new file
- `portal/src/pages/AnalyticsPage.tsx` — new file
- `portal/src/App.tsx` — two new routes
- `portal/src/components/AppLayout.tsx` — two new nav links
# Decision: Chart Interactions — Drag-to-Reorder & Expand Toggle

**Date:** $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
**Author:** McManus (Frontend)
**Status:** Implemented

## Decision

Used the native HTML5 Drag and Drop API for chart reordering instead of a third-party library (react-dnd, dnd-kit).

## Rationale

- Keeps bundle lean — no new dependencies
- HTML5 DnD API is sufficient for a 4-card grid reorder scenario
- Task constraint explicitly required this approach

## Layout Change

Migrated `TimeseriesCharts` from `flex-column` to a 2-column CSS grid. This is a visual change that affects how charts appear (side-by-side at ≥769px). Keaton should be aware in case this affects any screenshot tests or embedding contexts.

## Persistence

Chart order and expanded state are stored in `localStorage` under key `loom-chart-prefs` as `{ order: string[], expanded: string[] }`. No backend state required.

## Files Changed

- `shared/analytics/TimeseriesCharts.tsx`
- `shared/analytics/TimeseriesCharts.css`

# Multi-User Multi-Tenant Architecture

**Author:** Keaton (Lead)  
**Date:** 2026-02-26  
**Status:** Proposed — awaiting Michael Brown approval  
**Requested by:** Michael Brown  
**Scope:** Multiple users per org/tenant via invite links; users can belong to multiple tenants

## 1. Problem Statement

Current model: `tenant_users` table enforces 1:1 user↔tenant (email is `UNIQUE`). A user signs up, creates a tenant, and can never belong to another. Org owners cannot invite collaborators.

**Required:**
1. Org owner creates invite links → other users sign up or join under that invite
2. A single user (email) can belong to multiple tenants
3. Users can switch between their tenants in the portal UI

## 2. Schema Changes

### 2.1 New `users` Table (Auth Identity)

Separates authentication identity from tenant membership. Email is the unique auth key.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id            UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email         VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  last_login    TIMESTAMPTZ
);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users (email);
```

### 2.2 New `tenant_memberships` Junction Table

Replaces the 1:1 `tenant_users` table. One user can have multiple memberships.

```sql
CREATE TABLE tenant_memberships (
  id         UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id    UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  tenant_id  UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role       VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'member',
  joined_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, tenant_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_tenant_memberships_user_id   ON tenant_memberships (user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tenant_memberships_tenant_id ON tenant_memberships (tenant_id);
```

**Roles:** `owner` | `member`
- **owner:** manage invites, manage members, manage settings, manage API keys, view traces/analytics
- **member:** view traces/analytics (read-only)

This maps cleanly to the existing `ownerRequired` vs `authRequired` preHandler pattern in portal routes.

### 2.3 New `invites` Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE invites (
  id          UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tenant_id   UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  token       VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  created_by  UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  max_uses    INTEGER,          -- NULL = unlimited
  use_count   INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  expires_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  revoked_at  TIMESTAMPTZ,      -- NULL = active; set = revoked
  created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_invites_token     ON invites (token);
CREATE INDEX idx_invites_tenant_id ON invites (tenant_id);
```

**Invite token format:** 32 bytes, base64url-encoded (43 chars). Generated via `crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('base64url')`.

**Invite link URL:** `{PORTAL_BASE_URL}/signup?invite={token}`

### 2.4 Drop `tenant_users` Table

The old `tenant_users` table is fully replaced by `users` + `tenant_memberships`. Data migrated before drop.

## 3. JWT Strategy

### Decision: Keep `tenantId` in JWT, Switch via New Token

**Current JWT payload:** `{ sub: userId, tenantId: string, role: string }`  
**New JWT payload:** `{ sub: userId, tenantId: string, role: string }` — **identical structure**

**Rationale:** Every existing portal route reads `request.portalUser.tenantId` from the JWT. Keeping `tenantId` in the JWT means zero changes to middleware and zero changes to any existing route handler. The multi-tenant capability is additive.

**How switching works:**
1. Login returns `tenants[]` alongside the JWT (JWT issued for the first/default tenant)
2. Frontend stores the tenants list in memory/state
3. User clicks a different tenant in the switcher
4. Frontend calls `POST /v1/portal/auth/switch-tenant { tenantId }` 
5. Backend validates membership, issues a new JWT with the new `tenantId`
6. Frontend replaces the stored token and refreshes data

## 4. API Endpoints (15 total)

### Modified Endpoints
- `POST /v1/portal/auth/signup` — added `inviteToken` branch
- `POST /v1/portal/auth/login` — returns `tenants[]` array
- `GET /v1/portal/me` — returns `tenants[]` array

### New Auth Endpoint
- `POST /v1/portal/auth/switch-tenant` — switch active tenant, get new JWT

### New Invite Endpoints
- `POST /v1/portal/invites` — create invite (owner only)
- `GET /v1/portal/invites` — list invites (owner only)
- `DELETE /v1/portal/invites/:id` — revoke invite (owner only)
- `GET /v1/portal/invites/:token/info` — public, no auth

### New Member Management Endpoints
- `GET /v1/portal/members` — list members (any role)
- `PATCH /v1/portal/members/:userId` — update role (owner only)
- `DELETE /v1/portal/members/:userId` — remove member (owner only)

### New Tenant List / Leave Endpoints
- `GET /v1/portal/tenants` — list user's tenants
- `POST /v1/portal/tenants/:tenantId/leave` — leave tenant

## 5. Frontend Changes

### TenantSwitcher Component (Sidebar)
- Dropdown showing current tenant (or static text if only 1)
- List of all tenants from `tenants[]`
- Click triggers `POST /v1/portal/auth/switch-tenant`

### Updated Signup Flow
- Route: `/signup?invite={token}`
- Call `GET /v1/portal/invites/:token/info` to display tenant name
- Show "Join {tenantName}" form instead of org creation form
- Submit with `inviteToken` branch

### Members & Invites Page (`/app/members`)
- Members list with role badges, joined date, last login
- Invite management (create, list with use counts, revoke)
- Owner-only actions (role change, member removal)

### AuthContext
- Unified state: `token`, `user`, `tenant`, `tenants[]`, `loading`
- `useAuth()` hook for all components
- Handles `switchTenant()` action

### Navigation Updates
- Add Members link (owner-only visibility)
- Keep existing API Keys link

## 6. Migration Strategy

Single migration `1000000000011_multi_tenant_users.cjs`:
1. Create `users` table from `tenant_users` data
2. Create `tenant_memberships` junction table from `tenant_users` relationships
3. Create `invites` table (starts empty)
4. Drop `tenant_users` table

Data preserved: all existing users remain owners of their current tenant.

## 7. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Migration data loss on rollback | Users with multiple memberships lose all but first | Document as known limitation; take DB backup |
| JWT tenantId stale after removal | User removed but JWT still valid | JWT has 24h expiry; membership check on sensitive ops |
| Invite token brute force | Attacker guesses tokens | 32-byte random = 256-bit entropy; rate limit deferred to Phase 2 |
| Last-owner removal race condition | Two owners demote each other simultaneously | Use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` deferred to Phase 2 |

## 8. Phase 2 Deferred

- Email notifications for invites
- Invite role customization
- Tenant creation limits per user
- Transfer tenant ownership
- User profile management (change email, change password)
- Rate limiting on invite endpoints
- Audit logging for membership changes
- Last-owner race condition fix

# Multi-User Multi-Tenant: Backend Implementation Decisions

**Author:** Fenster (Backend Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## Decision 1: `inviteToken` branch silently ignores `tenantName`

**Context:** The spec says "When inviteToken is present, tenantName is ignored." The body type was widened to make `tenantName` optional.

**Decision:** No error is returned if `tenantName` is supplied alongside `inviteToken`. It is simply unused. This is the least-friction path for frontend clients that might always send all fields.

## Decision 2: Existing user joining via invite does NOT re-hash password

**Context:** When an existing user joins a second tenant via invite (email already exists in `users`), the invite flow skips password hashing entirely.

**Decision:** The existing user's credentials are untouched. The signup-via-invite path for existing users is essentially "add membership to my existing account." The password field in that case is superfluous.

## Decision 3: Login returns 403 (not 401) for zero active memberships

**Context:** A user could exist in `users` with no active tenant memberships (e.g., all tenants deleted).

**Decision:** Return 403 with `{ error: 'No active tenant memberships' }`. Authentication succeeded; the user simply has no accessible tenants. This is an authorization failure, not authentication.

## Decision 4: `PORTAL_BASE_URL` declared inside `registerPortalRoutes`

**Context:** The spec calls for `PORTAL_BASE_URL` from env, defaulting to `http://localhost:3000`.

**Decision:** Read `process.env.PORTAL_BASE_URL` inside the function body. This ensures the value is captured after `.env` file loading and allows test overrides without module re-imports.

## Decision 5: Soft-revoke only for invites

**Context:** Spec says `DELETE /v1/portal/invites/:id` sets `revoked_at = now()`.

**Decision:** Implemented exactly as spec. Hard-delete was not used because preserving revoked invites maintains an audit trail. The `isActive` computed field correctly reflects revoked status.

## Decision 6: `GET /v1/portal/invites/:token/info` — 404 for unknown, `isValid: false` for expired

**Context:** Spec says "Always returns `isValid: false` (not 404) for expired/revoked/exhausted tokens — prevents token enumeration."

**Decision:** Unknown token → 404. Known token but invalid (expired/revoked/exhausted/tenant inactive) → 200 with `isValid: false`.

## Decision 7: No `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on last-owner checks

**Context:** Spec notes a risk of race condition on last-owner count check.

**Decision:** Deferred to Phase 2 per spec. Missing FOR UPDATE means concurrent requests could both read "2 owners" and both proceed to demote, leaving zero owners. Acceptable for initial release.

## Decision 8: Migration preserves `tenant_users.id` as `users.id`

**Context:** Audit reveals no other tables reference `tenant_users.id`.

**Decision:** IDs are preserved verbatim in migration INSERT. Any existing JWTs (which embed `userId` = old `tenant_users.id`) remain valid immediately after migration without token refresh.

---

# Multi-User Multi-Tenant: Frontend Implementation Decisions

**Author:** McManus (Frontend Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## Decision 1: AuthContext as Single Source of Auth Truth

**Context:** Previously, each page component individually called `api.me()` on mount. Tenant switching requires replacing the token and refreshing state app-wide.

**Decision:** Created `portal/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` wrapping the entire app. All components use `useAuth()` hook. AuthContext owns: `token`, `user`, `tenant`, `tenants[]`, `loading`.

**Rationale:** Tenant switching needs to propagate instantly to all components. A context is the minimal correct solution.

## Decision 2: `currentRole` Derivation Strategy

**Context:** Role lives in JWT but also in `tenants[]` list returned from login/me.

**Decision:** `currentRole` is derived as:
```ts
tenants.find(t => t.id === tenant?.id)?.role ?? user?.role ?? null
```
Falls back to `user.role` for backward compatibility.

## Decision 3: Members Nav Link — Hide vs. Gate

**Choice:** Hide the Members nav link entirely for non-owners (not show disabled).

**Rationale:** Members without the link visible won't try to navigate there. The page itself still gates API. Consistent with how API Keys work.

## Decision 4: Invite Signup → Redirect to `/app/traces`

**Per spec:** On successful invite-based signup, navigate to `/app/traces` (not API key reveal, since members don't get keys).

**Implementation:** API `signup` response `apiKey` made optional (`apiKey?`).

## Decision 5: Tenant Switcher — No Page Reload

**Decision:** `switchTenant()` calls `POST /v1/portal/auth/switch-tenant`, replaces token, then calls `api.me()` to refresh context. No `window.location.reload()`.

**Rationale:** In-place state update is smoother UX. Any component subscribed to context will re-render automatically.

**Known limitation:** Pages that fetched data on mount will show stale data until navigation/refresh. Acceptable for Phase 1.

## Decision 6: Revoked Invites — Collapsed `<details>`

**Decision:** Revoked/expired invites shown in collapsed `<details>` element below active invites table.

**Rationale:** Keeps page clean. Owners rarely need historical revoked invites. No new dependencies.

# Architecture Document Created

**By:** Keaton (Lead)  
**Date:** 2026-02-27  
**Status:** Active

`docs/architecture.md` is now the **canonical architecture reference** for Loom.

## What Was Created

A 13-section architecture document grounded in the actual codebase, covering:

1. System Overview
2. High-Level Architecture (Mermaid diagram)
3. Component Breakdown (gateway, services, domain, infrastructure, routes, frontends)
4. Request Data Flow (sequence diagrams for streaming and non-streaming)
5. Multi-Tenancy Model (ER diagram, isolation mechanics, lifecycle)
6. Authentication & Authorization (three auth domains)
7. Database & Persistence (MikroORM, migrations, partitioning)
8. Analytics Pipeline (on-read SQL, cost estimation, subtenant rollup)
9. Provider Abstraction (class diagram, adapter patterns)
10. Encryption (AES-256-GCM envelope encryption)
11. Testing Strategy (Vitest, test patterns, coverage)
12. Configuration & Deployment (env vars, docker-compose, service topology)
13. Key Design Principles

## Impact

- README.md Architecture section updated to link to `docs/architecture.md`
- All future architecture discussions should reference this document
- Document reflects code-as-built, not aspirational design

## Maintenance

This document should be updated when:
- New services, routes, or providers are added
- Migration strategy changes
- Service topology changes (e.g., Phase 2 service split)
- Auth model changes

# Decision: Use `jsonwebtoken` directly for JWT signing/verification

**Date:** 2026-03  
**Author:** Fenster (Backend Dev)  
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

Loom had two separate JWT implementations:
- Admin routes used `@fastify/jwt` (Fastify plugin), calling `fastify.jwt.sign()` and `request.jwtVerify()`
- Portal routes used `fast-jwt` (`createSigner`/`createVerifier`)

This created unnecessary coupling to framework plugins and two different JWT libraries.

## Decision

Consolidate onto `jsonwebtoken` directly, with a shared `signJwt`/`verifyJwt` utility in `src/auth/jwtUtils.ts` and a generic preHandler factory `createBearerAuth` in `src/middleware/createBearerAuth.ts`.

## Rationale

- **No framework coupling**: `jsonwebtoken` works without registering a Fastify plugin; logic is portable and testable in isolation
- **Single library**: eliminates `fast-jwt` and `@fastify/jwt` as dependencies
- **Shared factory pattern**: `createBearerAuth` handles header extraction, verification, and 401 response uniformly for both admin and portal auth
- **Explicit secrets**: secrets are read from env vars in the middleware/service files directly, not passed through plugin registration

## Consequences

- `@fastify/jwt` and `fast-jwt` removed from `package.json`
- `jsonwebtoken` + `@types/jsonwebtoken` added
- 401 error messages unified to `{ error: 'Unauthorized' }` (no longer distinguishes missing header from invalid token)
- `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` and `PORTAL_JWT_SECRET` remain as separate env vars
- `request.adminUser` and `request.portalUser` shapes unchanged
