## Summary

End-to-end agent sandbox implementation. Users can click "Test" on any agent row to open a chat panel, interact with the agent in multi-turn conversation, and see token usage. Backend resolves agent hierarchy (including inherited system prompt/skills) and calls provider non-streaming. Traces not recorded (developer testing only).

**Files Changed:** 4  
**Insertions:** 331  
**Key Decisions:** 2 (no trace recording, sandbox ≠ editor)
